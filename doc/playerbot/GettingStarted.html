      This is a fork of playerbot with completely different AI based on strategies.

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>
First, create some characters that you wish to use as bots. <b>IMPORTANT: Create a guild!</b>
<br/>
Note that any character from your guild can be used as bot, nothing special is required. You can pick one to play yourself while controlling others as bots. Just remeber that only characters from your guild can be used as bots and they will obey their master only.
</p>

<p>
After you've made your characters just log in to the world and type in chat window
<pre>.bot add name1,name2,etc</pre>
where <i>name1,name2,etc</i> is comma-separated list of your guild characters you want to be bots.
</p>

<p>
Invite them to group (party or raid) and start playing.
</p>

<p>
When you don't require specific bots anymore type:
<pre>.bot remove name1,name2,name3</pre>
And they will log off
</p>

<p>
You can quickly add/remove in all bots from your group with the commands:
<pre>
.bot add *
.bot remove *
</pre>
</p>

<p>
There can be special accounts named <i>Random Accounts</i>. Basically these are accounts specified in <i>AiPlayerbot.RandomBotAccounts</i> configuration parameter. They can be used by any character and can be randomized or used for random PvP. If they are the same faction you can invite them into your group, play dungeons and raids together, etc. Opposite faction bots will not obey you, they flag themself with PVP and start random attacking in random zones and sometimes attack your main character (The server must be configured for PVP to use this feature)
</p>
<p>
To quickly boost your bot level and equipment the command:
<pre>
.bot init name1,name2,name3
</pre>
This will change specified bot level to the same your character has. The bot will learn all spells and abilities available at trainers at this level. Also bot's equipment will be randomized. This command is available only for random bots.
</p>

<p>
When your bots are logged in you can start playing with them: leveling, questioning, instances, raids awaits you!
