By default bots will stay in place until you command them doing another thing.

The following non-combat strategies can be used to control bot movement:
stay - stay in place (default)
follow - follow master
passive - don't attack, loot, etc. anything

If the bot is far away it needs to be teleported to you. If there is a meeting stone nearby, select the bot then right-click the stone. When the summoning portal is open, select the bot you want to teleport then right-click the portal. Bot will be summoned. NOTE: there is no need to another player to summon bots.
If you are in the instance or raid, but bot is not whisper
summon
they will be summoned (like a dungeon finder)

If you take a flight node to somewhere whisper
fly
no late than 5 secs after the flight is started and bots will fly with you the same node

HINT: you can there several macros and bind them to action bar or keys:

=== Flee ===
/g reset
/g nc -stay,+follow,+passive
/g co +passive
/g do follow

=== Follow ===
/g nc -stay,+follow,-passive
/g co -passive
/g do follow

=== Stay ===
/g nc -follow,+stay,+passive
/g co +passive
/g do stay
