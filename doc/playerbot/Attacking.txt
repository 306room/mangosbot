If you want bot to attack some creature, target the creature and whisper
do attack

Several strategies can be used to simplify this process:

tank assist
Assist party players (including bots) by attacking more threated target. This is single tanking stategy.

tank aoe
Frequently switch target between more threated targets. This is AOE tanking strategy.

dps assist
Assist party players by attacking less threated target. This is single dps stategy.

dps aoe
Frequently switch target between less threated targets. This is AOE tanking strategy.

grind
Attack any visible target

Note that you need to add/remove this stategies to both combat and non-combat category unless you want bot to stop assisting if it is in combat for example.

By default tank classes have tank assist strategy, others have dps assist.
