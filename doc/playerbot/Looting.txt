Bots can loot corpses, gameobjects, etc. Note: by default this is turned off.

If you want them to loot something, select the loot object and whisper
d loot

If you want them to loot automatically, apply loot non-combat strategy:
nc +loot

You can control which items to loot by whispering:

l gray
They will loot only gray (poor quality) items

l quest
They will loot only quest items

l normat
They will loot anything except BOP (bind-on-pickup) items.

l all
The will loot everything

Hint: you can combine looting with grind strategy. Bots will attack and loot everything they see including corpses, gameobjects, herbs, mining, skinning, etc. You can just stand still and wait they do all the dirty work.
