Beside strategies there is a number of commands can be used to interact with bots in some way.

stats
Bot will reply about their gold, experience, bag space, repair cost

quests
Bot will reply with their quest list divided by status (completed/incompleted)

q [quest]
Bot will tell specified quest status

drop [quest]
Bot will drop the specified quest status. Note bot must be selected before doing so.

If you pick a quest when bot is in range, he will pick the quest as well. When you turn-in the quest, bot will turn-in it as well (of course if it is completed). 
You can share shareable quest with the bots - they will accept it.
